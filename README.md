# modulo-calculator

This is a simple utility to calculate the modulo of packages.

# Install

Clone the repository and then execute:

`yarn install`

After that, you should have a `dist/` directory with the Javascript files. You can use node to run them but if you prefer to make an executable, run:

`yarn package`

This will create executables of the files for mac, linux and windows.

# Use

2. Specify the divisor
3. ???
4. Profit!! (well, you may not be the one who profits, but anyways, profit!)
